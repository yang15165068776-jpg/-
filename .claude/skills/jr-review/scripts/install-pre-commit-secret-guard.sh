# install-pre-commit-secret-guard.sh — install the /jr-review pre-commit secret-guard hook
#
# Called by /jr-review at Phase 5.6 only when (a) the user accepted the User-continue
# path AND (b) chose [Install hook] at the AskUserQuestion. Appends the canonical
# template (delimited by `# BEGIN claude-secret-guard` / `# END claude-secret-guard`)
# to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`. Refuses to install if any prerequisite fails — ad-hoc
# variants are out of scope.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Usage:
#   install-pre-commit-secret-guard.sh
#
# Output (stderr, on any non-zero exit):
#   one or more reason lines suitable for the Phase 7 report skip-log
#
# Stderr wording convention:
#   "Pre-commit hook installation aborted — …"  → tamper-class (exit 2, 4, or 5); the operator
#     must NOT install and should audit the source.
#   "Pre-commit hook installation skipped — …"  → user-fixable prerequisite or
#     environmental issue (exit 1 or 3); the operator resolves and re-runs.
#   "Pre-commit hook block already installed — no-op."  → idempotent re-install success
#     (exit 0); no action required.
# Operators with log-grep alerting should match on the leading phrase to bucket by class.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — installed (or block already present and idempotent re-install was a no-op)
#   1 — prerequisite missing (jq absent, .git missing, no shasum/sha256sum on PATH,
#       flock contention) — user-fixable; the operator installs the missing
#       binary (or moves to a real git working tree) and re-runs
#   2 — template SHA-256 mismatch OR template file missing entirely (tampering or
#       corrupted install) — DO NOT install
#   3 — incompatible existing hook (non-bash shebang) — caller logs skip and moves on
#   4 — stale hook block on disk (installed body differs from canonical template) —
#       caller surfaces as ACTION REQUIRED; user must manually disarm + re-run
#   5 — multiple claude-secret-guard blocks present (TAMPERING SUSPECTED) — caller
#       surfaces as ACTION REQUIRED; user must manually remove ALL blocks + re-run
#
# Distinction between exit 1 and exit 2: BOTH the no-hash-tool branch (the "else"
# arm of the "command -v shasum"/"command -v sha256sum" ladder) and the missing-template
# branch (the [ ! -f "$templatePath" ] guard immediately preceding it) bypass the
# SHA-256 verification. They diverge on cause and remediation:
#   - No hash tool: environmental (BusyBox / hardened minimal container with neither
#     shasum nor sha256sum). Recoverable by installing coreutils. → exit 1.
#   - Missing template: skill files are incomplete; either an interrupted install or
#     a tamper signal. NOT recoverable by the operator without re-fetching the canonical
#     skill source — manually recreating the template would bypass the SHA check
#     against an unknown body. → exit 2.
#
# Caller dispatch contract: see jr-review/protocols/pre-commit-hook-offer.md
# "Install procedure" — its `case $ec in ... esac` block MUST cover every exit code
# above. When adding a new exit code here, update the caller in the same commit.
#
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# SHA-256 verification
#
# Maintenance contract: when the canonical template changes intentionally, all
# four steps below MUST land in a single commit. The hash check is the only
# tamper-evidence the install path has — a stale EXPECTED hash silently breaks
# every user's install path with exit 2 (which mimics a tamper signal).
#
#   1. Edit `../templates/pre-commit-secret-guard.sh.tmpl`.
#   2. Run `shasum -a 256 ../templates/pre-commit-secret-guard.sh.tmpl`.
#   3. Update `EXPECTED_TEMPLATE_SHA256` below to the new hash.
#   4. Commit all three (template + script + any prose) together. /jr-doctor's
#      template-hash drift check (Group I, when implemented) catches step 3
#      omissions; until then, the cryptic exit-2 in the field IS the signal.
